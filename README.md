## Starting with the generate_bboxes postprocessing

Bunch of scripts for some simple post-processing of [GTAVisionExport](https://github.com/umautobots/GTAVisionExport) repo.

It is another kind of post-processing than is mentioned in their paper. For their original post-processing, 
see [this repo](https://github.com/umautobots/gta-postprocessing).

You need to connect to database where managed plugin stores data.
Copy file `gta-postprocessing.ini.example` to `gta-postprocessing.ini` and there fill the database credentials.
